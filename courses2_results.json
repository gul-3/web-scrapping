Through ministries or central state agencies dedicated to cultural affairs, the investments in public cultural facilities and activities and support for independent art and culture providers have been managed. The aims of such centralized cultural policy systems have been to support the artistic and cultural provision at a national level. However, in the last three decades, with the deindustrialization of the heartlands of industrial revolution, new areas of economic activity have been sought after in order to inject new opportunities for income generation. It has been in this context that cultural policy agenda started to address the role of cultural and artistic investments in local development. The focus of cultural policy shifted towards the local level with a new emphasis on local governance of cultural resources. The question that many local governments (such as districts, cities, rural areas, towns, villages) started to ask was how to use cultural investments in order to generate economic activity as well as social and cultural benefits through local cultural policy and cultural planning. This agenda, over time, developed further to cover issues of sustainability and resilience and mitigation in the face of environmental crisis. The aim of this course is to understand the role of artistic and cultural investments in local contexts for aims that are to do with both the well being of citizens but also to do with local development, local identity, place-making, and also with more societal aims such as cultural pluralism, participatory governance and cultural rights. Over the 14 weeks of teaching, we shall be looking at various local cultural policy examples with a focus on cultural planning that various local government bodies have put in place.

Turkey has become the biggest host country for refugees with 3,6 million Syrians, following the civil war in Syria in 2011. According to a research of Konda Research and Consultancy, the percentage of people who do not want to live with Syrians in the same city increased from 40% in February 2016 to 72 % in July 2019. This rate of increase points to the need to address the question of how we are going to live in peace. 15.Istanbul Biennale curators Elmgreen & Dragset titled their programme ‘a good neighbour’ inviting artists to reflect on what constituted in today’s world a good neighbour. Among many questions they posed,the question ’Is a good neighbour someone who lives the same way as you?’reflects the complex agenda concerning how to live together in peace in our increasingly complex societies of flows. In this course we shall examine the ‘othering’ mechanisms at work towards those who are deemed different -  migrants, refugees, travelers, different life styles and sexual orientations, different ethnicities, language and identity communitites. In all the instances of cultural (mis)representation, we find a certain kind of politics of discrimination and exclusion at work. In this class we shall be looking at how cultural representations of what is marked as the ‘other’ or the ‘minority’ end up producing misrepresentations. Multiculturalism is a specific approach to address this issue of misrepresentation. We shall examine cultural policy measures and bottom-up multiculturalism initiatives led by arts and cultural organisations that aim to foster cultural dialogue, recognition, equal representation and free expression of cultural diversity.",
