            "course_description": "Most engineering problems can be formulated as an optimization problem. In addition to mathematical programming, different methods have been studied in operations research to solve the optimization problems. However, traditional methods are often not efficient enough when the solution space is large and complex. Many problems encountered in operations research are NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. In order to solve these problems efficiently, different search methods which are based on the intuitive and creative thinking, namely heuristic methods, have been used in search of the sub-optimal solutions.   \r\nOn the other hand, global optimum solutions can be obtained systematically and efficiently by using metaheuristic methods, which are higher level heuristics that control the entire search process. Although metaheuristics do not always guarantee to get the global optimum solution, they can provide very good results for many practical problems. This course will focus on the role and the usage of heuristic and metaheuristic approaches in optimization. Evolutionary algorithms such as genetic algorithm, memetic algorithm and ant colony optimization will be analyzed as well as methods such as tabu search, simulated annealing, and iterated local search. The effectiveness of these methods has been proven by experiments, but the theoretical foundations are still weak, since they are primarily based on human intuition. For this reason, this course will introduce the basic idea of each method and give a clear understanding in the working principles of each method. Mathematical proofs will also be used when necessary.",
