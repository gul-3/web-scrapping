However, what is the state of fashion in the contemporary world, and more importantly, what is its future? As a forward-moving, complex, and cyclical entity, fashion is not only a means of self-expression but also a reflection of cultural values, identity, and societal change. FBA 213: Exploring Creative Possibilities course examines how the fashion industry is undergoing a transformative shift, influencing and being influenced by cultures ad global practices, and explores how this process is mutually interchangeable. The course explores the intersections of fashion design, sustainability, and cultural practices. The course examines fashion's essential components, such as newness, body, industry, cultural appreciation, and craft, through a lens of ecological and ethical responsibility. The course also emphasizes the importance of cultural capital, habitus, and appreciation for global and non-Western fashion practices.\r\nSustainability and the Role of Design:\r\nThis course critically examines fashion’s environmental and ethical responsibilities, tracing the impact of the fashion industry’s continuous cycles of consumption and disposal. Various approaches to sustainability, including zero-waste design, emotionally durable design, and circular economy principles, will be explored to clarify definitions and distinguish genuine sustainable practices from corporate greenwashing while analyzing the environmental impact of the fashion industry. The course emphasizes the materials used in fashion production (planet // source), the influence of designers in shaping ethical and sustainable practices (people // make + use), and the evolving business models that challenge fast fashion (profit // service-product systems).\r\nCreative Engagement and Hands-on Exploration:\r\nThrough hands-on assignments, students will develop critical design thinking and technical skills, including pattern-making, material sourcing, and sustainable collection development. The course fosters an appreciation for cultural capital, habitus, and non-Western fashion traditions, encouraging students to integrate storytelling and ethical considerations into their design practice. The latest innovations in sustainable fashion, such as slow fashion, product-service systems, and regenerative materials, will be analyzed to inspire students to approach fashion as a tool for social change.\r\nBy exploring creative possibilities through informed design practices, students will develop new ways of thinking, designing, and responding to contemporary fashion challenges. The course encourages students to critically engage with current debates about fashion’s trajectory and envision alternative futures where sustainability, ethics, and cultural appreciation redefine the industry.\r\nThe course aims to empower students to conceptualize, design, and present sustainable collections that embody a responsible and forward-thinking approach to fashion.",

Buyers need to be in touch with and anticipate what customers will want to buy, but this ability to sense market trends is just one skill needed to manage merchandise inventory effectively. Perhaps an even more important skill is the ability to analyze sales data continually and make appropriate adjustments in prices and inventory levels.\r\nWe will discuss how the process is organized, who makes the merchandise decisions, and how merchandise management performance is evaluated. Then examines the steps in the merchandise management process—forecasting sales, formulating an assortment plan, determining the appropriate inventory level, developing a merchandise management plan, allocating merchandise to stores, and monitoring performance, more detailed discussion of the steps used to develop a merchandise budget plan. \r\nAfter creating an assortment plan for the category, forecasting sales, and developing a plan outlining the flow of merchandise (how much merchandise needs to be ordered and when it needs to be delivered), the next step in the merchandise management process is to acquire the merchandise.\r\nWhether offering national or store brands, the category manager negotiates many issues, such as prices, delivery dates, payment terms, and financial support for advertising and markdowns. The buying process for store brands is often more complex than for national brands because the store takes an active role in developing the products.\r\nWe begins with a description of the different merchandise branding alternatives. Then we review the issues involved in buying national and store brands, including negotiating with vendors. Next, the development of strategic partnering relationships between retailers and their suppliers is discussed.

CRM enables retailers to develop a base of loyal customers and increase its share of wallet—the percentage of the customers' purchases made from the retailer.\r\nThe business press and retailers are talking a lot about the importance of becoming more customer-centric and managing their customer relationships better. Retailers are spending millions of dollars on computer systems to collect and analyze data about their customers. With all this buzz, you would think that the customer is a popular new kid in the neighborhood. However, the customer is more like an old friend who's been taken for granted—until now.\r\nTraditionally, retailers have focused their attention on encouraging more customers to visit their stores, look through their catalogs, and visit their websites. To accomplish this objective, they have used mass-media advertising and sales promotions to attract visits from customers. This approach treats all existing and potential customers the same. They all receive the same messages and the same promotions. Now, retailers are concentrating on developing customer loyalty and increasing share of wallet by providing more value to their best customers by using targeted, personalized merchandise, services, and promotions. \r\nRetail Customer Service is the set of activities and programs undertaken by retailers to make the shopping experience more rewarding. These activities increase the value customers receive from the merchandise and services they purchase. Some of these services are provided by store and call-center employees interacting directly with customers, while others are provided by the design of the retailer's store and/or website.",

Accordingly, the course consists of two main modules: 'the urban question' and 'the public question'. The first module begins with a historical & theoretical framework that focuses on the contradiction of exchange & use value dimensions of urban development. After that, as a midterm evaluation, each student group is asked to examine a specific urban district that embodies two different urban patterns with different qualities in terms of both historical and morphological aspects. To this end, a rich case study pool is presented to students in a perspective ranging from planned - isotopic urban forms (city of developers) to organic - heterotopic urban - spatial practices (shaped by the needs and desires of people). In addition to the case studies, this first part of the course continues with seminars on the fundamental concepts of urban development - density, land use, zoning, mixed-use development, transportation and some other standards & regulations of land development, such as GSR, FSR, OSR, MXI, etc.\r\nThe second main module of the course is devoted to discussions of publicity, public sphere, and public space. In this context, the course is reinforced by two successive assignments. Both assignments are designed to help students establish theoretical and practical connections between the two modules. The urban patterns examined by the students in the first module will be expected to be reevaluated at this stage in the context of public life and the physical characteristics of public space. As a final requirement, students will develop conceptual & spatial design strategies for their selected project areas. During the design process, some of the basic concepts of urban design (such as legibility, distinctiveness, accessibility, enclosures, comfort, safety, landmarks, vistas, focal points etc.) will be the core of the discussions.",

Building on the basic design concepts and principles learned in ID 101, it introduces students to industrial design processes. The course begins with exercises involving two-dimensional and three-dimensional composition, compilation, arrangement, and reconstruction concepts, after which it starts to focus on the concept of products and product design. With an emphasis on creating \"Product Identity,\" students undertake projects that involve creating two-dimensional designs on existing objects to understand product form and usage. Following this, the concept of functionality in existing products is examined, and a design project is conducted by making adjustments based on functionality. Next, a product design project is carried out to study the concept of form. This project allows students to experience one, two, and three-dimensional materials. Students work to understand the relationships and transitions between dimensions, thereby grasping the importance of material usage and preferences in the design process. Finally, an industrial design project is completed with limited material choices on a predetermined topic to prepare students for the \"Industrial Design Studio\" courses in subsequent semesters.",

Through the discussion of key figures, theoretical approaches, and ideas, it also aims to develop the students' skills in understanding and critically evaluating interiors in relation to their geographic, social, historical, political, and cultural context.\r\nAt the beginning of the semester, each student will be asked to select a certain ‘place’ which they experience in their everyday lives to comment and criticize.

As midterms, students will submit a paper draft as a trial of expressing their ideas and criticisms with academic references. Papers comprising different approaches from different discourses will be a bonus.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the semester, each student will submit a final paper on the place in question, with an argument, a stance of their own, improved by discourses and supported by references they were introduced throughout the course.",
