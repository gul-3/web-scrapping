            "course_description": "Near the end of the nineteenth century and in the early twentieth century, the traditional concept of humanity was perceived as ending, giving way to something unknown. In an essay devoted to Charles Baudelaire written in 1913, Paul Verlaine described Baudelaire, a pivotal figure in these movements, as epitomizing the essence of modern man—shaped by the excesses of civilization, with heightened senses, and a complex mind. As another prominent figure of the modernist movement, James Joyce, through his character in “The Dead”, referred to this period as a “thought-tormented age”. Throughout this time of unprecedented upheaval, writers sought new themes, emotions, and experimental forms to interpret and challenge their unfamiliar and disorienting new world. Accordingly, this course examines the relationship between modernity and narrative as explored in the works of the ‘Modernist’ writers and we will explore this crisis of humanity from the late nineteenth century, marked by a sense of exhaustion and foreboding, into the tumultuous twentieth century. We will examine the selected texts as explorations into the unknown, efforts to break away from outdated conventions and discover new forms of intensity, knowledge, love, and redemption. \r\nSome guiding questions include: How did these narratives present life experienced as what Hardy called ‘the ache of the modern’? How was narrative transformed under the pressures to adequately express such experience? How did the ‘modernist’ novel both transmit and contest ‘modernity’?",

            "course_description": "Near the end of the nineteenth century and in the early twentieth century, the traditional concept of humanity was perceived as ending, giving way to something unknown. In an essay devoted to Charles Baudelaire written in 1913, Paul Verlaine described Baudelaire, a pivotal figure in these movements, as epitomizing the essence of modern man—shaped by the excesses of civilization, with heightened senses, and a complex mind. As another prominent figure of the modernist movement, James Joyce, through his character in “The Dead”, referred to this period as a “thought-tormented age”. Throughout this time of unprecedented upheaval, writers sought new themes, emotions, and experimental forms to interpret and challenge their unfamiliar and disorienting new world. Accordingly, this course examines the relationship between modernity and narrative as explored in the works of the ‘Modernist’ writers and we will explore this crisis of humanity from the late nineteenth century, marked by a sense of exhaustion and foreboding, into the tumultuous twentieth century. We will examine the selected texts as explorations into the unknown, efforts to break away from outdated conventions and discover new forms of intensity, knowledge, love, and redemption. \r\nSome guiding questions include: How did these narratives present life experienced as what Hardy called ‘the ache of the modern’? How was narrative transformed under the pressures to adequately express such experience? How did the ‘modernist’ novel both transmit and contest ‘modernity’?",

Even though comparative historical sociology is usually considered to be a subfield of sociology, its general approach, and specific methodologies employed by the historical sociologists are historically grounded. These characteristics allow historians to have a constructive dialogue with another discipline that they generally avoid. Second, the comparative dimension is crucial for historians to think outside of their specializations. This is especially important for the historiographical traditions that attribute some kind of uniqueness to their historical trajectories—both in the West and the rest of the world. Thirdly, comparative historical sociology is interested in very big questions about the dynamics of the modern age, and problematizes many of the feature of the modern world—from the emergence of modern nation-state, to the construction of modern identities; this approach will be immensely helpful for historians to avoid ahistorical approaches and narratives. Finally, even though it is taken for granted that we have been living in a globalized world, thinking history globally requires a good deal of critical reflection, and concomitantly, the field of global history has produced specific approaches and methodologies. Historians should have a good understanding of this diversity.",

The big questions include the debates about the uniqueness of Western modernity, the transition from feudalism to capitalism, the emergence of the modern states, and the dynamics of the revolutions.  The comparative component is more theoretical and includes such issues as To what extent is historical sociology different from history and sociology? What is the relationship between agency and structure?
